The project is written in Visual Studio IDE. Hence, the unit tests for the code is also written using `Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools` library.
Notice that the data structures implementation and the unit tests for them are separated as 2 different projects. This is a standard way to writting
unit tests in Visual Studio.
